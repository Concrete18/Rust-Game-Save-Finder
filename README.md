# Game Save Finder

Rust Powerered Game Save Finder. This program will use a score system to find the most likely save location.

## Purpose

I wanted to learn Tauri and improve my skills with Rust. To do so, I decided pull the Save Path Search code

I wrote for my Game Save Manager written with Python/Rust into its own separate program so anyone can use it with a simple installation.

## Development

### Development Command

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build Command

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Installer will be found in the following folder.

`src-tauri\target\release\bundle`

## Todo

- Replace title bar so maximize button no longer exists

## Issues

- App can often start out as just a white background until it fully loads
